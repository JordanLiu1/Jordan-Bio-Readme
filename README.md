# Jordan-Bio-Readme
Hi, I'm Jordan Liu and I'm currently a rising junior in high school. 
With the use of Github, I hope to display projects and my profolio, thereby connecting with other tech professionals on the platform.
Furthermore, I hope with the introduction to Github can develop my programming skills in a more professional environment.
